                    My name is Kevin Gutierrez and I come from California in the United States. I have traveled across the US and now find myself in the great country of Denmark while learning as much as I can about Multimedia Design and Communication. I have some photography and videography in my background but I also have an extensive background in the sciences. My educational background consists of one year at Arizona State University while also spending one semester at College of Marin back in California. <br> I don't have any proper work experince in the sense of being hired by someone to work, but I do have experience running a business that my Mother owned as well as a large background knowledge in Options day trading in the US stock exchange.
