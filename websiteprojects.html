                In all the projects you see bellow, I have been the project manager for all of them and have gotten an extensive feel of what it means to be a leader. Through each and every project I have been presented with different challenges that have forced me to grow as a leader and force me to overcome obsticales as a team member rather than a solo player. I have also recieved a wide range of coding situations that have greatly developed my ability as a coder and has pushed me to my uncomfortable limits where I have been able to push past them and grow as a person.

                    This was our first project done at Zealand. This was created after two weeks of work with only a small introduction to HTML and CSS.<br> In this project, I was the project manager while also responsible for creating the home page, <br> and connecting all the pages together so that it would work as one website even though that was not part of the requirments of the project since for most of us, <br> this was our first time being introduced to coding through Visual Studio Code
